In this repository, we have a Web Application made with MEAN stack.

Server side developed using Node.js, Express, Mongoose
Client side developed using Angular, Bootstrap, Material

Users must authenticate to use the application on the client side. There are two user types: Admin and Regular.

Admin can add, update, delete users and can see all the users in the database.
Admin and regular users can send message, read inbox and outbox.
